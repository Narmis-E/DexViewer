## About Release 1.0.0:

This is an initial release in the spirit of "release early, release often".\
Currently the interface can retrieve the past 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours of BG data.\
Dexviewer is currently limited for 1 user and has no option to change users 
on the fly, something planned for 1.1.0.\
Also planned for near future updates is functionality for live updating, as
currently Dexviewer only displays static timeframes with the exception of the sync glucose function.

### Versioning explanation:

Dexviewer will take after the semantic versioning scheme proposed by https://semver.org, as I believe
it best reflects the changes made to Dexviewer with an x.y.z format 
(x = major change, y = minor change and z = bugfix). I doubt there will ever be a X.y.z change,
as Dexiewer will most likely not be written in another toolkit, nor will it likely be updated to future versions
of GTK. I expect there will be many x.Y.Z version changes however.
