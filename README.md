# DexViewer
A GTK-4 interface for viewing Dexcom CGM data from the pydexcom API.


## Notes
Does not work well with GTK Themes and is made with the default Adwaita theme in mind.\
I would HIGHLY reccomend you do not `export GTK_THEME {theme}` in your bashrc or zshrc, or use a gtk4 theme in your `~/.config/gtk-4.0` for this appliction as I cannot guarrantee the application will look or even function the same from desktop to desktop.\

## TODO
- [ ] Direct window transfer from Home to Viewer
- [ ] Implement folder structure
- [ ] Pip package
- [ ] Decrease data load times?
